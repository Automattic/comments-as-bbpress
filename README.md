# comments-as-bbpress
Comments as bbPress - Replaces the comments section of a regular post with a bbPress subforum

### Usage

* Install bbPress alongside [this plugin](https://github.com/Automattic/comments-as-bbpress/zipball/trunk).
* Activate both.
* Enjoy!

#### Extras

* Use alongside [Blocks-Everywhere](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocks-everywhere/) by installing the plugin and adding `define( 'BLOCKS_EVERYWHERE_BBPRESS', true );` to `wp-config.php`

### Known issues

* As bbPress, it doesn't work with block themes, nor themes that don't use PHP template pages(except twentytwentytwo as it includes a hack (with unkown consequences) for it).
